naked-docker
============

Scripts to create naked (extremely minimal) Docker images for various Linux distributions.

These are created using dotcloud's mkimage.sh script, which will be downloaded as necessary.

This repository exists primarily to document the method by which the ceejatec/naked-* images in the Docker index were created.
